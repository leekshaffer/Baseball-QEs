Methods and analysis for the impact of rule changes on MLB and its players, using quasi-experimental methods and panel data.

A Shiny App to interactively display results of the analysis is available at:
https://bit.ly/SCM-baseball

Or by using the app.R file in this repository.

For re-use, the analysis files are in order beginning with "01-import.R". Any changes to later-numbered files do not require re-running earlier-numbered files. Note that "03-Players.R" runs the synthetic controls and takes the longest amount of time.
